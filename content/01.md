# 01 - Setting up a Go development environment
I am going to use a Windows 10 x64 Virtual Machine (VM) but Go is available for most popular platforms. I can already hear the infosec pros grunt. The [Getting Started][go-install] section on Go website has how-tos for most popular platforms. You can find binaries and building instructions.

You can get free Windows VMs from [modern.ie][modern-ie-vms]. Make a snapshot after you everything is set up. They expire in 90 days and you can only re-arm them multiple times.

## Installation on Windows 10 VM

1. Go to [https://golang.org/doc/install][go-install] and download the MSI binary.
2. Install the MSI, choose the default location.
3. Choose a development directory. I have created a shared directory in my VM. This way I can code in host and run the guest. In my case it 's `Z:\Go` where Z is the shared drive/directory.
4. Set the following environmental variables (installer might have already set some up):
    - `GOROOT`: `C:\Go`
    - `GOPATH`: `Z:\Go` or the directory from step 3.
5. Add `C:\Go\Bin` to PATH.
6. Open a new cmd and run `go env`. You should see what you have setup.

Output of `go env` in my Windows 10 VM is:

```
$ go env
set GOARCH=amd64
set GOBIN=
set GOEXE=.exe
set GOHOSTARCH=amd64
set GOHOSTOS=windows
set GOOS=windows
set GOPATH=Z:\Go\
set GORACE=
set GOROOT=C:\Go
set GOTOOLDIR=C:\Go\pkg\tool\windows_amd64
set GCCGO=gccgo
set CC=gcc
set GOGCCFLAGS=-m64 -mthreads -fmessage-length=0 
 -fdebug-prefix-map=C:\Users\IEUser\AppData\Local\Temp\go-build352203231=/tmp/go-build
 -gno-record-gcc-switches
set CXX=g++
set CGO_ENABLED=1
set CGO_CFLAGS=-g -O2
set CGO_CPPFLAGS=
set CGO_CXXFLAGS=-g -O2
set CGO_FFLAGS=-g -O2
set CGO_LDFLAGS=-g -O2
set PKG_CONFIG=pkg-config
```

<a name="gopath"></a>
## GOPATH
You can write Go code anywhere but only code in a `GOPATH` directory can be executed with `go run`<sup>2</sup>.

Go to the development path in step 3 of last section and create three directories inside it:

- `src`: Source code.
- `bin`: Compiled files.
- `pkg`: Executables.

You can clone this repository in `src` and then run everything in `code`. The directory structure looks like in the Windows 10 VM:

```
Z:\Go>tree /F

Z:.
├───bin
├───pkg
└───src
    └───Hacking-with-Go
        └───code
            └───01
                    01-01-HelloWorld.go
```

<a name="test-application"></a>
## Test application
Let's write a quick "Hello World" application and run it.

``` go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```

And we can run it with `go run 01-01-HelloWorld.go`.

``` go
Z:\Go\src\hacking-with-go\code\01>go run 01-01-HelloWorld.go
Hello World!
```

<a name="editor"></a>
## Editor
Choose whatever you like. There are many editors with Go support (you will see below) to choose from. Some in no particular order are:

- [SublimeText][sublime-link] using [GoSublime][go-sublime-link] package.
- [Atom][atom-link] via [go-plus][go-plus-link] package.
- [Visual Studio Code][vs-code-link] with [Go extension][vs-code-go].
- [Vim-go][vim-go].
- [Emacs go-mode][emacs-go-mode].

I personally use Sublime Text 3 and GoSublime.

<a name="go-playground"></a>
### Go playground
The online go playground at [https://play.golang.org/][go-playground] is good for prototyping/testing and sharing quick scripts. It's pretty useful when Go is not installed on the machine. For more information read [Inside the Go Playground][inside-go-playground].

<a name="offline-coding"></a>
### Offline coding
It's possible to run both the playground and documentation server offline.

- `godoc -http :1234` will run the the documentation server at `localhost:1234`.
- `go tool tour` will start an offline version of [Tour of Go][tour-of-go] at `localhost:3999`. This allows coding offline in browser in Go playground.

<a name="gofmt"></a>
## gofmt
`gofmt` is Go's official formatting tool. It automatically modifies source code. The main reason behind choosing an editor with Go support is running `gofmt` automatically on your code.

I personally do not agree with `gofmt`. For example it uses tabs (I like spaces). Tab-width is fixed at four (I like two). But it's better if our code adheres to language standards.

For more information read [go fmt your code][gofmt-your-code]. For usage see [Command gofmt][command-gofmt].

<a name="starting-curly-brace"></a>
## Starting curly brace
The starting curly brace needs to be on the same line as the the keyword starting the block (e.g. `for` or `if`). This is a Go standard enforced by the compiler. It's explained in the Go [FAQ][faq-curlybrace].

This is wrong:

``` go
func main()
{
    fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```

This is correct:

``` go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```
