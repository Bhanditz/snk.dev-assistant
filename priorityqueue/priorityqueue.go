/*Package priorityqueue implements a series of performant, concurrency safe data structures
used for priority queues.

Hierarchical Queue - O(1) priority queues for large amounts of small priorities (uint8)

Hierarchical Heap - O(log n/k) priority queue for large amounts of data, slower than HQ but has no limitations.*/
