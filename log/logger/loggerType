// A Logger represents an active logging object that generates lines of
// output to an io.Writer. Each logging operation makes a single call to
// the Writer's Write method. A Logger can be used simultaneously from
// multiple goroutines; it guarantees to serialize access to the Writer.
type Logger struct {
	mu     sync.Mutex // ensures atomic writes; protects the following fields
	prefix string     // prefix to write at beginning of each line
	flag   int        // properties
	out    io.Writer  // destination for output
	buf    []byte     // for accumulating text to write
