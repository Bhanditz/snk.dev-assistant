== session keystore should contain:
expiration time
email
user id

== web should have:
middleware should requireAuth
/login should unconditional (re)authenticate via CAS

== need things to:
x require auth (if auth, do nothing, if not auth'd, force auth)
x force auth (401 for httpbasic, 302 for cas)
  - shipping can call require auth
  - /login call force auth

== Todo
- check go cas library if `ST-` and `PT-` tickets are handled the same or whatever
x 403 for xhr
x 90 minutes expiration
- scrub ticket from query params?

== Note on configuration
x configuration env vars
x session expiration as env var

== After shipping is configured for CAS
1. map model using activemodel, hook it to a CRUD controller, expose via form
2. automation comes after
3. billing shipping to someone in backend app using standalone shipping via button of sorts?

4. Where to put shipping link in navbar?
5. How do we want to show non-printed labels?
5. How do we want print labels?
6. What other improvements?
  - button to import order from somewhere
  - `/shipping/:order_id/new` ?


NB: write tests in shipping app
