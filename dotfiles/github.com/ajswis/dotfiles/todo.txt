todo:
===
rename validateAndPrepare appropriately
integration tests for "hold for location"
integration tests that ship to somewhere not 38018
ups future date shipping is not supported because UPS reasons
UPS hold at location not supported because I forgot, but is it really important?
  maybe should error in these conditions
re-evaluate transitTimeFromString(...) returning -1 (because of shipping reqs)
maybe refactor fedex Client.ship() and tests
should arrival deadline accept a time as well as date? >>NOT YET, ADD STORY/ASK DREW, FOR SIMPLICITY USE DATE FOR NOW<<
what should we do if fedex/ups doesn't give us a transit time or delivery by date?
  reject this service?
  should we try to fish out/infer the information like time in transit requests do?
  should we be more aggressive about inferring that information?



we need to make a holiday list for FedEx Ground, document how to update/verify it, and note it in the README
maybe wrap the holiday list into a `Calendar` type?
move the current list to `DefaultCalendar`, add a separate list for `FedexGroundCalendar`?

Calendar dates like this are bad, mmkay:
Fri. Before Christmas Eve
FedEx Ground: Modified Service [4]
[4] FedEx Ground will make pickups and deliveries. For packages picked up on 12/22/2017, most of them will transit and be delivered as usual, while some of the packages with a standard transit time of 2 or more days may experience 1 additional transit day.
we could model that by having `func (c Calendar) ModifyTimeInTransitByPickupDate(time_in_transit int, pickup_date time.Time)` which returns `time_in_transit` for all dates except that one
having said that, I'd prefer to put that footnote on a TODO and defer it until after we've got more things working


optimizations:
===
FAN OUT REQUESTS INTO GOROUTINES
FAN OUT CARRIER REQUESTS (ie just shipping, since each package is shipped separately) INTO GOROUTINES
don't rate if len(options) == 0
rate similiar boxes only once
should packages be evaluated separately or collectively?
send shipments using multi-package shipments when possible (ie non-returns)

features:
===
dry run on shipping
asap option which is different from priority overnight >>NOT UNTIL WE ACTUALLY NEED IT<<
budget based requirements on a shipment >>THIS WILL JUST BE PREFERENCE<<
