order component takes id as prop to get ajax
make ajax, call setstate on self on response

order component to get info about order
  has render, delegates to other component
  render is smart enough to differentiate between states
    if has info about order, show pack this order
    if not, show loading
  once has data, create new component and do things

barcode, customevent, register event
