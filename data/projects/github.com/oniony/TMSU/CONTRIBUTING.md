First of all, thank you for considering to contribute to this project! Please get in [contact](mailto:paul.ruane@oniony.com?subject=Contributing%20to%20TMSU) to chat about what you would like to work on, though the [TODO list](https://github.com/oniony/TMSU/wiki/TODO) and [issue
tracker](https://github.com/oniony/TMSU/issues) are good places to start.

I built this project for several reasons:

  * I disliked the opaque, proprietary solutions available for tagging files
  * I thought the idea of presenting tagged files as a virtual filesystem was unique (it transpires it wasn't)
  * I wanted to learn a new programming language
  * I wanted to have a pet project to work upon outside of work

When you have found something you'd like to work on, please get in touch to discuss approach. Please also try to
break it down into small pieces so that each pull request can be small. It's much easier to digest a small PR than
a huge one, it's less disappointing if changes have to be made and it's much easier to steer the project that way.

Thanks again, I look forward to collaborating with you.

Paul
