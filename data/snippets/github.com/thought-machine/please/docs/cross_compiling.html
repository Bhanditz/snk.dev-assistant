<h1>Cross-compiling</h1>

<p class="experimental">This feature is still experimental; some aspects may not work fully
  or at all just yet. Proceed with caution!</p>

<p>From v12.2 onwards, Please has limited cross-compiling support. This allows you to
  instruct it to build outputs for other architectures alongside the host architecture.<br/>
  This is triggered by passing the <code>--arch</code> flag when invoking plz.</p>

<p>The outputs from a cross-compiled build will be in a directory under plz-out prefixed
  with the architecture - e.g. <code>plz-out/bin/linux_x86</code>,
  <code>plz-out/gen/darwin_amd64</code> etc.</p>

<h3>Technical notes</h3>

<p>When compiling a target for a different binary, the BUILD file will be re-parsed for it.
  The <code>CONFIG.ARCH</code> and <code>CONFIG.OS</code> properties will update appropriately,
  which is necessary for some rules to work correctly. Similarly, when the rule builds, the
  <code>OS</code> and <code>ARCH</code> environment variables will be set to the target architecture
  for that build target.</p>

<p>The distinction between <code>srcs</code>, <code>tools</code> and <code>deps</code> is
  <b>extremely</b> important when cross-compiling. <code>srcs</code> always match the architecture
  of the target, as do <code>deps</code> unless explicitly requested (e.g. by prefixing with
  the required arch, as in <code>@linux_x86//package:target</code>).<br/>
  Conversely, <code>tools</code> always use the host architecture since they are executed on
  the host during the build.</p>

<p>The <a href="config.html">config file</a> for any target architecture is read
  (if present) and applied for targets compiling for that architecture - i.e.
  <code>.plzconfig_linux_x86</code> etc. Typically you will need to create this file and
  modify appropriate settings for compiler flags etc.</p>

<p>Architectures are currently always two-part tags in a similar format to Go's - i.e.
  <code>linux_amd64</code> etc. These are passed in as a single flag but decomposed into
  separate OS and architecture parts for later operations. You can request whatever architecture
  you want, but obviously the build will probably not succeed unless you have tools set up etc.</p>

<h3>Language status</h3>

<p>The various builtin languages have differing levels of support. Currently they are as follows:
  <ul>
    <li><b>C</b> & <b>C++</b>: Works at least for basic cases; there is an example in the
      <a href="https://github.com/thought-machine/please/tree/master/test/cross_compile">Please repo</a>
      which tests a simple amd64 -> x86 compilation.<br/>
      You will need to alter the config file to make this work - see the
      <a href="https://github.com/thought-machine/please/blob/master/.plzconfig_linux_x86">example for x86</a>
      for some examples of the settings to change.<br/>
      So far this has not been tested in anger on a more complex setup.</li>
    <li><b>Go</b>: Generally works, but you currently have to have a copy of the standard
      library available for the target architecture. Go can produce that via something like
      <code>GOOS="linux" GOARCH="386" go install -i std</code>.</li>
    <li><b>Python</b>: Currently has very limited support. Theoretically it will mostly work
      for pure Python; for binary modules built locally they'll need a similar approach to C.<br/>
      For third-party binary modules <a href="lexicon.html#pip_library">pip_library</a> is unlikely
      to work since pip can't be instructed to use a different architecture;
      <a href="lexicon.html#python_wheel">python_wheel</a> should be fine but requires something else
      to have built & hosted the .whl file.</li>
    <li><b>Java</b>: This is not terribly relevant to Java since it effectively always targets
      the same JVM architecture. <a href="lexicon.html#maven_jar">maven_jar</a> rules that
      specify <code>native = True</code> will download for the target architecture.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
