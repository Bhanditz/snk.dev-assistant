# 04 - Go networking
Now that we are done with the basics and packages, we can start learning about networking. Following Black Hat Python, let's start with networking basics and then move on.

Go's networking capabilities are in the [net][net-pkg] package and its sub-packages like [net/http][net-http-pkg]. The Python equivalent to `net` is `socket` and `net/http` can be compared to the 3rd party `Requests` module.
