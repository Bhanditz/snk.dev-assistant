# 03 - Useful Go packages
This is where this repo is going to divert a bit from BH books. This section is going to be simple guides to Go packages that will be used later. For example the `flag` package is used to create and process command line parameters and is a building block of almost every security script that hopes to be re-used. Some packages like `net` are more complex and better learned in action while building/using tools.

As I move forward and learn more, I will return and add more tutorials here.

- [03.1 - flag package](03.1.md): Parsing command line parameters.
- [03.2 - log package](03.2.md): Logging.
