<h1>Third-party dependencies</h1>

<p>Sooner or later, most projects end up needing a dependency on some
  third-party libraries, and one of the jobs of the build system is to
  manage those as well. Please is no exception to this, but it bears a
  little discussion since most systems handle this differently.</p>

<p>In Please, third-party dependencies can be created in any BUILD file
  and manipulated as any other build rule. We encourage methods of fetching
  them that are repeatable; typically each language has one that matches
  up to a common package manager, for example:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="lexicon.html#go_get">go_get</a></li>
    <li><a href="lexicon.html#pip_library">pip_library</a></li>
    <li><a href="lexicon.html#maven_jar">maven_jar</a></li>
  </ul>
  Each of these require explicit declarations of all their dependencies in the
  BUILD file; this is how we pin dependencies & guarantee reproducibility.<br/>
  There are one or two alternatives that show slightly different approaches
  (e.g. <a href="lexicon.html#python_wheel">python_wheel</a> or
  <a href="lexicon.html#maven_jars">maven_jars</a>) as well, and
  <a href="lexicon.html#remote_file">remote_file</a> which is a general tool to
  download anything (although often more work is required to actually build it)</p>

<p>The typical idiom we use is to place BUILD files under a third_party directory,
  to make it clear where they're coming from. Commonly we separate them by language
  for multi-language repos as well.<br/>
  See <a href="https://github.com/thought-machine/please/tree/master/third_party/go">third_party/go</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/thought-machine/please/tree/master/third_party/python">third_party/python</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/thought-machine/please/tree/master/third_party/java">third_party/java</a>
  in Please's repo for some examples of what these look like.</p>

<p>There's no explicit command to download third-party dependencies (e.g. <code>plz fetch</code> or similar).
  Dependencies are built as part of the build process along with everything else, so
  their downloads can be parallelised with compiling other targets.</p>

<h2>Comparison to other systems</h2>

<p>For users familiar with Bazel, we expect that writing BUILD files won't be
  challenging, the main difference being that there is no direct equivalent to
  Bazel's WORKSPACE file. As mentioned above, third-party dependencies can occur
  wherever you choose to put them in normal BUILD files.<br/>
  Right now there is no direct equivalent to Bazel's <code>new_http_archive</code>
  and similar, but this is definitely on the <s>roadmap</s> wishlist.</p>

<p>If you've used Buck before, the model is pretty similar to fetching Maven jars
  using the bucklet for it. This is not entirely coincidental since we were previously
  using Buck so initially Please had to mimic the same interface - but we also
  quite liked it and decided to keep on in the same way.</p>

<p>If you're coming from Gradle or Maven, it's a little more alien due to being less language-specific
  and requiring full transitive dependencies to be specified.<br/>
  <a href="lexicon.html#maven_jars">maven_jars</a> is the closest equivalent to declaring
  Maven dependencies in the same way that Gradle does it; it works by communicating with
  Maven repositories to find dependencies and generating more BUILD rules for them. This can
  be a little unreliable though, since the Maven package format is complex, and your dependencies
  aren't fully within your control and can change between builds - we recommend
  <a href="lexicon.html#maven_jar">maven_jar</a> instead, but understand it's more work to set up.</p>

<p><code>requirements.txt</code> files from Python are not usually especially difficult to
  translate using <a href="lexicon.html#pip_library">pip_library</a>; again we require listing
  transitive dependencies explicitly, but this is not normally too onerous for Python.<br/>
  Since Please needs to know precisely what will be output, the rules can sometimes need a little
  tweaking when the output names don't correspond to the package names (or often a package outputs
  a single .py file instead of a directory).</p>

<p><a href="lexicon.html#go_get">go_get</a> works pretty similarly to the usual <code>go get</code>
  tool, but again only outputs a single package at a time. Writing up the dependencies can be
  eased by using something like <code>go list -f '{{.Deps}}' &lt;package&gt;</code> to discover
  all the dependencies for the package in question.</p>
