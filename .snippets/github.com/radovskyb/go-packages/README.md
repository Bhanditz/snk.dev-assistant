# go-packages
A large repository of code and documented examples for Go's standard package library.

`go-packages` is a large collection of code examples and documentation for a large majority of the functions and methods from Go's standard package library.

# Requests
If anybody would like to make any requests for old or non idiomatic examples that I might have written or found straight from the web, to be updated or re-written, or if there are any examples that you want added, whether it be from the packages already on here, more complex versions of current examples, or examples from packages that are missing, feel free to let me know or just open up an issue on this repo :)

# Contributing
If you would ike to contribute, simply submit a pull request.

# Description
When I first started learning Go, I started to write this repo to help myself learn as many of the functions and methods as I possibly could from the standard package library.

A lot of these examples can be found directly by skimming through the docs (http://golang.org/pkg), however for the examples that were missing, I either found or modified examples by Googling directly for what I wanted to learn if it seemed complicated, or if the ideas were either easy enough for me to work out or no examples were readily available at the time, I would just write them myself.
